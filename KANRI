While the terms health, wellness, and well-being are often used interchangeably, there are subtle differences between them:

Health: This refers to the absence of disease or illness. It's a more objective state, measured by things like physical fitness, absence of chronic conditions, and functionality of bodily systems.

Wellness: This focuses on actively pursuing behaviors and choices that improve your overall health. It's subjective and personal, incorporating physical, mental, emotional, and social aspects. Examples include eating healthy, exercising regularly, and engaging in activities that bring you joy.

Well-being: This is the broader outcome of both health and wellness. It encompasses an overall sense of happiness, life satisfaction, and fulfillment. It includes not only physical health, but also factors like strong relationships, meaningful work, and purpose in life.

Here's an analogy:

Think of health as the ground level. It's the basic foundation you need to function.
Wellness is like building on that foundation. It's the effort you put in to strengthen and expand your capabilities.
Well-being is the beautiful garden you create on top. It's the flourishing result of both the ground and the work you put into it.
Key differences:

Focus: Health focuses on absence of disease, wellness on active pursuit of health, and well-being on overall life satisfaction.
Objectivity: Health is more objective, wellness is subjective, and well-being is subjective and multi-faceted.
Control: You have more control over your wellness choices than your inherent health, and both contribute to your well-being.
Remember, these are interconnected concepts. Taking care of your health through good choices contributes to your wellness, and both contribute to your overall well-being.
